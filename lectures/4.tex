\lecture{5}{Jan 30}{Stable Matching}

\section{Propose and Reject}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Job proposes to its favorite candidate
  \item Candidate holds favorite job on a string and rejects all others
  \item If no jobs are rejected, algorithm halts
\end{itemize}

\section{Properties}
Stable matching gets better every day for candidates

\begin{lemma}[Improvement Lemma]
  If on day $t$ a candidate $c$ has a job $j$ on a string, any job, $j'$ on
  candidate $c$'s string for any day $t'>t$ is at least as good as $j$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  $P(k)$ - "Job on $c$'s string is at least as good as $j$ on day $t+k$"
  By induction, base case: $P(0)$ - true, candidate has $j$ on string.
  Assume $P(k)$. Let $j'$ be job on string on day $t+k$.
  On day $t + k + 1$, job $j'$ still on string. Candidate $c$ can choose $j'$
  or do with a better job $j''$. That is $j' \ge j$ by inductive hypothesis.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  There is no rogue couple for the matching formed by stable matching algorithm.
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}[$x$-optimal matching]
  x's partner is its best partner in any stable pairing.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[$x$-pessimal matching]
  x's partner is its worst partner in any stable pairing.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[job-optimal matching]
  It is $x$ optimal for all jobs.
\end{definition}
